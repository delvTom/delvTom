# Hi, I'm Tom !

I'm an M2 student in **Mathematics, Statistics and Machine Learning (MS2A)** at **Sorbonne University**.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **mathematical theory** and **modern machine learning**.

 **I am currently looking for a 6 month M2 internship starting in April 2026.**.I am strongly interested in research, and I am considering pursuing a PhD after my M2 on mathematically grounded machine learning topics.
My interests include **modern deep learning**, **reinforcement learning**, **large language models**, **generative AI**, and **stochastic optimization** — broadly, any topic that is both mathematically and algorithmically challenging.
